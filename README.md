The user will input two single digit numbers of their choice. The user will begin by inputting two single digit numbers of their choice. The program will add the two numbers, and will output only the one's digit of the sum of the two numbers. This process will continue until the two original numbers that the user inputted at the start are seen at the end. The program will stop once those same two numbers are seen at the end.
